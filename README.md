# Tienda UCN Frontend

This project consists of the simplified implementation of the frontend of the “Tienda UCN” e-commerce platform using Next.js. This includes the creation of views, user session and shopping cart management, proper use of rendering strategies and global states.

The website is created with a mobile-first approach, so that it is responsive to different screen sizes and maintains a pleasant and fluid user experience.

In addition, the system is designed to be used in conjunction with a Rest API created with ASP .NET Core, which allows for the management of user and product data.
